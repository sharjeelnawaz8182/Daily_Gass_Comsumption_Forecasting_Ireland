# Daily_Gass_Comsumption_Forecasting_Ireland
This project forecasts daily gas consumption in Ireland using the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. By analyzing historical data, the model predicts future consumption, aiding in energy planning and resource allocation. It incorporates seasonal patterns and trends, with feature engineering and data preprocessing.
